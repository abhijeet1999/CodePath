Submitted by: **Abhijeet Cherungottil**

**Memory Match Game** is a fun and interactive card-flipping puzzle game built using **SwiftUI**. The player‚Äôs goal is to find all matching pairs by remembering the positions of flipped cards. The game tests short-term memory and focus, offering multiple difficulty levels to keep users engaged.

Time spent: **8 hours** in total

## Notes

Some challenges I faced while building the app:
- Handling state updates correctly so that unmatched cards flip back smoothly.
- Managing animations and delays to ensure cards don‚Äôt flip too quickly.
- Maintaining a clean layout for different grid sizes.
